Environment
    Environment should change by itself 
    Add poison, walls etc.    

Brain
    debug is a brain parameter set at init.
    add removeNeurons - ones that have no synapses?
    
Neuron
    RANDOM SIGNALS GENERATION
    add remove synapses - ones that had were flatlining.

Synapse
    GET CODE THAT ENCODES SYNAPSE's GAIN VS ACTIVITY profile

Visualization
    PROPERLY DISPLAY FOOD
    visualize brains for debugging purposes (cubes, neurons, synapses. maybe in 2D ?)
    
Population management
    Every x populations report to ES best brains codes.
    Every y populations randomly swap few brains from different populations.
