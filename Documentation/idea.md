Evolve brains that are:
* "born" with some pathways
* can quickly learn
* are adaptable to different environments
* optimizaton goal: prosper & multiply

Approach
* brain is a cube with _sensors_ on one side and _actuators_ on other.
* brain is split into cubes
* each cube contains only one kind of neurons.
* evolution can change:
    * cubes
        * which cube gets what kind of neurons.
        * cube parameters: number of neurons per cube
    * neurons
        * length of inputs
        * lenght of outputs
        * synapse activation function
        * what it does with synapses with trivial input (too high/low/unchanging rate)
        * change with time (age)
* world
    * individuals advertize energy
    * realisticly simple
    * mating when they connect
    * die when no energy left
    * energy is scarce

* code
    * need a "DNA" that governs development and work of the cells.
